# Pocket App — Cursor AI Rules

This is a web-first AI conversation recorder app (like Pocket AI but software-only).
Read CLAUDE.md for full project context before making any changes.

## Stack
- React (Vite) web app → React Native later
- Sarvam AI for Indian language transcription
- Node.js/Python backend (TBD)
- User-selectable LLM for summarisation (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)

## Code Style
- TypeScript preferred
- Component-based, keep components small and focused
- No over-engineering — build for current requirements only
- Mobile-first CSS even for web (will become React Native)

## Key Features to Build (in order)
1. Recordings list screen with bottom drawer (summarise / ask AI / share / delete)
2. AI chat screen (ask questions across all recordings)
3. Onboarding flow (voice registration to identify owner)
4. Audio recording + Sarvam AI transcription
5. Speaker diarization with rename capability
6. Model selection in settings

## Important
- Multi-language support: Hindi, English, regional Indian languages
- Speaker diarization is critical — label as User-1, User-2 etc., allow renaming
- Keep UI clean and simple — the recordings list is the core screen
